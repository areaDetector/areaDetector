Introduction
------------

This is a guide for installing and building R3-0 and later of the EPICS
areaDetector module. This guide is intended for both areaDetector users
and developers. areaDetector can be obtained as a release or by cloning
from the github repository.

This guide provides instructions for:

-  Installing, building, and running from source code. These
   instructions should work on any supported EPICS host architecture,
   e.g. Linux, Windows, macOS, vxWorks. This document assumes that the
   reader has already installed an EPICS development environment, and
   has built `EPICS base <https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base>`__, the
   `EPICS asyn
   module <https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn>`__, and the
   required `EPICS synApps
   modules <https://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps>`__.

-  Installing and running a pre-built binary distribution.

Installing and Building from Source Code
----------------------------------------

The build process attempts to make the build process easy for typical
cases but allow site specific overrides. areaDetector uses many other
products.

EPICS Products Required for Building areaDetector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

areaDetector requires `EPICS
base <https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/index.php>`__. R3.14.12.4 or
higher, any 3.15 release should work.

areaDetector also requires
`asyn <https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/>`__. The most
recent release of asyn is recommended.

Each areaDetector detector module builds both a library and an EPICS IOC
application. To build the library only EPICS base and asynDriver are
required. To build the IOC application the
`synApps <https://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps>`__ modules AUTOSAVE,
BUSY, CALC, and SSCAN are required. If the CALC module is built with
SNCSEQ support then SNCSEQ is also required. The most recent release of
the synApps modules is recommended.

The DEVIOCSTATS and ALIVE modules are optional.

EPICS base, asyn and the synApps modules must be built before building
areaDetector.

External Products Required for Building areaDetector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

areaDetector optionally uses the NETCDF, TIFF, ZLIB, JPEG, SZIP, HDF5,
NEXUS, GRAPHICSMAGIC, OPENCV, and EPICS PVA (formerly V4) libraries.
These are used for plugins and drivers and are not required. The XML2
library is required.

Prior to areaDetector R2-5 the TIFF, ZLIB, JPEG, SZIP, XML2, HDF5
libraries needed to be installed on Linux. On Windows they were provided
as pre-built libraries in the ADBinaries module in areaDetector. NETCDF
and NEXUS were built from source in ADCore.

Beginning with R2-5 the ADSupport module was added to areaDetector.
This module builds the GRAPHICSMAGICK, NETCDF, TIFF, ZLIB, JPEG, SZIP, XML2,
HDF5, BLOSC, and NEXUS libraries from source code. ADSupport on
Darwin may be added in a future release. ADSupport will almost always
be used to build the libraries on Windows and vxWorks.

On Linux each library can either be built in ADSupport or installed in
a location external to areaDetector.

For each library XXX (XXX=TIFF, NETCDF, etc.) there are 4 Makefile
variables that can be defined in ``CONFIG_SITE.local``. 
  
- WITH_XXX
    - If WITH_XXX=YES then build the plugins and drivers that require this
      library. 
    - If XXX_EXTERNAL=NO then also build the source code for this
      library in ADSupport. 
- XXX_EXTERNAL
    - If NO then build the source code for this library in ADSupport. 
    - If YES then this library is installed external to areaDetector 
- XXX_INCLUDE
    - If XXX_EXTERNAL=YES then this is the path to the directory
      containing the include files for XXX. This can be a space-delimited
      list of paths if more than one directory is required. XXX_INCLUDE
      should only contain the paths, without a preceeding -I. The -I will be
      added in the Makefiles. However, if XXX is a system library whose include
      files are in a standard include search path then do not define XXX_INCLUDE. 
- XXX_LIB 
    - If XXX_EXTERNAL=YES then this is the path to the library files for XXX. 
      However, if XXX is a system library whose library files in a standard 
      library search path then do not define XXX_LIB.

XML2 is an exception. It is required, so WITH_XML2 is not supported, but
XML2_EXTERNAL, XML2_INCLUDE, and XML2_LIB are supported.

Note that there are some library interdependencies. 
- If ``WITH_TIFF=YES`` then ``WITH_ZLIB`` must also be ``YES``. 
- If ``WITH_HDF5=YES`` then ``WITH_ZLIB`` and ``WITH_SZIP`` must also be ``YES``. 
- If ``WITH_NEXUS=YES`` then ``WITH_HDF5`` must also be ``YES``.

ADSupport can be used to build the libraries for the following
operating systems. 

- Linux
    - 32/64 bit, Intel architectures only. 
- Windows
    - Visual Studio or mingw, 32/64-bit, static or dynamic 
- vxWorks 
    - On vxWorks 6.x all libraries are supported.
    - On vxWorks 5.x only XML2, TIFF, ZLIB, JPEG, and NETCDF are
      supported. WITH_SZIP, WITH_HDF5, and WITH_NEXUS must be set to NO 
- Darwin
    - This is not currently supported but will be added in a future release.

The following instructions can be used for installing these libraries
externally to areaDetector if that is desired.

TIFF, JPEG, XML2, and Z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Linux and Darwin the libtiff, libjpeg, libxml2, and libz libraries
often come already installed. If they are not already installed then
they are normally available for installation via the standard package
installation tools, e.g. “yum install” on Redhat systems, “apt get” for
Debian systems, etc.

If for some reason you cannot install these libraries using the standard
package installation tools, they can be installed from source code
distributions as follows.

For each product download the source code from a product download site
and then build.

Each site provides some combination of .zip, .tar, .tar.gz, etc. If the
file is a zip file then just execute:

::

    unzip file.zip

If the file is any flavor of tar just execute:

::

    tar xf file

All of the following products put the result of unzip or tar into a
sub-directory. cd to that directory and follow the instructions for the
appropriate sub-section.

TIFF
^^^^

This can be downloaded from
`libTIFF <http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff>`__. Then click on the
Master Download Site and download the latest stable release. After the
latest release is unziped cd to the release and execute the commands:

::

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

The include and library files are installed by default into
``/usr/local``

ZLIB
^^^^

This can be downloaded from `zlib <http://www.zlib.net>`__.

Then look for latest release download.

After untaring the release

::

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

The include and library files are installed by default into
``/usr/local``

JPEG
^^^^

This can be downloaded from
`libjpeg <http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/libjpeg.html>`__.

Read the instructions from the web site about installing. I suggest that
it be installed into ``/usr/local`` instead of ``/usr``. Thus to
install:

::

   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local  \
        --mandir=/usr/share/man \
        --with-jpeg8  \
        --disable-static \
        &&; \
   sed -i -e '/^docdir/ s/$/\/libjpeg-turbo-1.3.0/'   \
        -e '/^exampledir/ s/$/\/libjpeg-turbo-1.3.0/' Makefile &amp;&amp;
   make
   make test
   sudo make install

XML2
^^^^

This can be downloaded from
`libxml2 <http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html>`__.

Then look for latest release download.

After untaring the release

::

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install


HDF5, SZIP, and GRAPHICS_MAGICK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Linux and Darwin these libraries may not be installed, and may not be
available via the standard package installation tools. Follow these
steps to install them from source.

SZIP
^^^^

This can be downloaded from
`SZIP <http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP>`__.

Click on **SZIP Source** and download the release that appears.

After the latest release is untared, cd to the release and execute the
commands:

::

   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
   make
   make check
   sudo make install

HDF5
^^^^

This can be downloaded from `HDF
Group <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`__.

Click on Downloads, then Current Release, then HDF5 Software, then
Source Code, then latest release.

After the latest release is untared, cd to the release and execute the
commands:

::

   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 --with-szlib=/usr/local
   make
   make check   
   sudo make install
   make check-install

GRAPHICSMAGICK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This can be downloaded from
`Sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick>`__

After the latest release is untared, cd to the release and execute the
commands:

::

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

Downloading and Installing areaDetector Source Code
---------------------------------------------------

The areaDetector source code is kept on
`gitub.com/areaDetector <https://github.com/areaDetector>`__.

It can be downloaded 2 ways:

**Via the “git clone” command**

::

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/areaDetector/areaDetector.git

After downloading with ``git clone --recursive`` each submodule will be in a
“detached HEAD” state. This means that its state will be that of the
last time that module was committed to the top-level areaDetector
repository. This is normally not the desired state for each submodule.
Rather, one should cd to each submodule and type either
``git checkout master`` to work on the master branch, or
``git checkout RX-Y`` to use release RX-Y of that submodule.

**By downloading tar.gz or zip file**

A specific release of each module can be downloaded through a Web
browser or by the wget command:

::

   wget https://github.com/areaDetector/areaDetector/archive/R2-6.tar.gz

If downloading tar files then each repository must be downloaded
separately. To build the “core” of areaDetector the following
repositories must be downloaded:

-  ``areaDetector/areaDetector``
-  ``areaDetector/ADSupport``
-  ``areaDetector/ADCore``

To build the simulation detector, which is very useful for learning
areaDetector and for testing, also download

-  ``areaDetector/ADSimDetector``

To also build a specific detector, for example the ADProsilica, also
download

-  ``areaDetector/ADProsilica``

The areaDetector software is designed to be installed in the following
tree structure, though this is not required. If it is installed this way
then only the top-level ``areaDetector/configure`` directory needs to be
edited for site-specific configuration.

::

   areaDetector
     ADSupport
     ADCore
     ADSimDetector
     ADCSmDetector
     pvaDriver
     ADPilatus, etc.

RELEASE\* and CONFIG\* files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

areaDetector RELEASE\* and CONFIG\* files are a little more complex than
those in a typical EPICS module. This is because they are designed to
meet the following requirements: 

- If using the top-level areaDetector
  repository then it is only necessary to edit the CONFIG\* and RELEASE\*
  files in the ``areaDetector/configure`` directory, and not in each of the
  submodules, of which there are now about 40. 
- Allows building multiple
  architectures in the same tree, including Linux and Windows. This means
  that ``SUPPORT`` and ``EPICS_BASE`` may be defined differently for different
  architectures, since the path syntax is different for Linux and Windows.
- Allows using the top-level
  `synApps/support <https://github.com/epics-synApps/support>`__ and
  `synApps/support/configure <https://github.com/epics-synApps/support/configure>`__
  directories. If these are used then one can edit
  ``synApps/support/configure/RELEASE`` to set the locations of ``EPICS_BASE`` and
  the versions of asyn, calc, etc. Typing ``make release`` in the
  top-level synApps/support directory will update the RELEASE\* files in
  all modules defined in that ``RELEASE`` file, including those in
  ``areaDetector/configure``. 
- Allows using the Debian EPICS package for
  ``EPICS_BASE`` and the support modules (asyn, calc, etc.). It is also
  possible to use the Debian package for some of the modules, but use more
  recent versions of some modules (e.g. asyn) that are built from source.

After all the required products have been installed and a release of
areaDetector has been downloaded then do the following in the
areaDetector/configure directory:

::

   cp EXAMPLE_RELEASE.local         RELEASE.local
   cp EXAMPLE_RELEASE_LIBS.local    RELEASE_LIBS.local
   cp EXAMPLE_RELEASE_PRODS.local   RELEASE_PRODS.local
   cp EXAMPLE_CONFIG_SITE.local     CONFIG_SITE.local

On Windows you must do the following:

::

   cp EXAMPLE_CONFIG_SITE.local.WIN32   CONFIG_SITE.local.WIN32

You may also want to copy the architecture dependent example files if
you are building for multiple architectures in a single build tree, for
example:

::

   cp EXAMPLE_CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86_64            CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86_x64
   cp EXAMPLE_CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86.vxWorks-ppc32 CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86.vxWorks-ppc32

You can copy all of the ``EXAMPLE_*`` files to the files actually used with
the ``copyFromExample`` script in the ``areaDetector/configure`` directory. If
you do this then be sure to edit the
``CONFIG_SITE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)`` for your ``EPICS_HOST_ARCH`` as well.
For example ``CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86_64`` defines ``WITH_BOOST=YES`` and
this may need to be changed if you do not have the boost-devel package
installed. You can see your local modifications with the ``diffFromExample``
script.

Edit RELEASE_LIBS.local
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The definition for ``SUPPORT`` normally points to the directory where the
areaDetector, asyn, and the synApps modules (autosave, busy, calc, etc.)
are located.

The location of ASYN, AREA_DETECTOR and EPICS_BASE must be specified.
asyn and areaDetector are normally placed in the SUPPORT directory
defined in this file.

As described above ``RELEASE_LIBS.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)`` can be used if the
ASYN version or path is different for a specific target architecture. This is
usually not necessary even for building Linux and Windows in the same tree,
because, as described below, only the definitions of ``SUPPORT`` and ``EPICS_BASE`` in the
top-level ``$(AREA_DETECTOR)/../RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).local``
need to be changed for Windows.

If WITH_PVA=YES is defined in CONFIG_SITE.local and EPICS_BASE version
is prior to 7.0 then PVA must define the location of the EPICS PVA
(formerly EPICS V4) libraries. Beginning with EPICS base 7.0 the PVA
files are in EPICS base and PVA should not be defined.

If using Debian packages then the following must be done: 

- SUPPORT should be defined to be the root location of any modules which should
  **not** come from the Debian package. 
- Any modules which should come
  from the Debian package should be commented out, except for ``EPICS_BASE``.
- For example to use a newer version of asyn and areaDetector then
  define ``ASYN``, ``AREA_DETECTOR``, ``ADCORE``, and ``ADSUPPORT`` here. To use the
  Debian version of asyn then comment out ``ASYN`` here.
- In the ``SUPPORT`` tree for those modules not from the Debian distribution
  (e.g. asyn) their ``configure/RELEASE`` files should also not define
  anything except ``EPICS_BASE`` to point to the location of the Debian
  package. For example if building asyn from source in the ``SUPPORT`` tree
  and IPAC and SNCSEQ from the Debian package then comment out the lines
  for IPAC and SNCSEQ in ``asyn/configure/RELEASE``.


Edit RELEASE_PRODS.local
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the notes for ``RELEASE_LIBS.local`` above.

The definitions for ``AUTOSAVE``, ``BUSY``, ``CALC``, and ``SSCAN`` must be specified.  
If the CALC module is built with SNCSEQ support then SNCSEQ must also be specified. 
If DEVIOCSTATS or ALIVE are defined in ``RELEASE_PRODS.local``
then IOC applications will be built with these modules as well.

Optionally create or edit $(AREA_DETECTOR)/../RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).local
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some installations chose to build for multiple target architectures using
different development machines in the same directory tree on a file server. In
this case the path to SUPPORT may be different for each architecture. For
example SUPPORT on Linux might be ``/home/epics/epics/support``, while on a
Windows machine using the same copy of support the path might be
``J:/epics/support``. In this case ``RELEASE_LIBS.local`` and ``RELEASE_PRODS.local``
could specify the path for Linux while ``$(AREA_DETECTOR)/../RELEASE.windows-x64.local``
could specify the path for the windows-x64 build host. RELEASE_LIBS.local or
RELEASE_PRODS.local will be read first, and then 
``$(AREA_DETECTOR)/../RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).local`` if it exists.
Note that ``$(AREA_DETECTOR)/../`` is typically the same as ``synApps/support``.

Edit CONFIG_SITE.local and optionally CONFIG_SITE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file is used to define which support libraries are to be used, and
if a library is to be used then where it should be found. The following
definitions are needed.

::

   WITH_BOOST=YES or NO

boost is needed only to built the test programs in
``ADCore/ADApp/pluginTests``. If ``WITH_BOOST=YES`` then ``BOOST_INCLUDE`` and
``BOOST_LIB`` can be defined to point to the locations of the boost library.
If the boost include and library file are located in default system
locations then ``BOOST_INCLUDE`` and ``BOOST_LIB`` should not be defined.

::

   WITH_PVA = YES or NO

EPICS PVA (formerly V4) libraries are needed for the NDPluginPVA in
ADCore and the pvaDriver repository. To build these components set
``WITH_PVA=YES``. If using a version of ``EPICS_BASE`` prior to 7.0 then define
the location of the PVA libraries in ``RELEASE_LIBS.local`` and
``RELEASE_PRODS.local``. If using EPICS_BASE 7.0 or later it is not
necessary to define PVA in these files because the PVA files are located
in EPICS_BASE.

-  NETCDF JPEG, TIFF, ZLIB, SZIP, XML2, HDF5, NEXUS, GRAPHICSMAGICK,
   OPENCV

   -  NETCDF is required for the NDFileNetCDF plugin
   -  JPEG is required for the NDFileJPEG and GraphicsMagick
   -  TIFF is required for the NDFileTIFF and GraphicsMagick
   -  ZLIB is required for the NDFileTIFF and NDFileHDF5 plugins
   -  XML2 is required for ADCore
   -  HDF5 is required for the NDFileHDF5 and NDFileNexus plugins
   -  NEXUS is required for the NDFileNexus plugin
   -  GRAPHICSMAGICK is required for the NDFileMagick plugin and the
      ADURL driver
   -  OPENCV is required for the ADPluginEdge plugin

For each library XXX (XXX=TIFF, NETCDF, etc.) there are 4 Makefile
variables that can be defined in ``CONFIG_SITE.local``.

- WITH_XXX
    - If ``WITH_XXX=YES`` then build the plugins and drivers that require this
      library. 
    - If ``XXX_EXTERNAL=NO`` then also build the source code for this
      library in ADSupport. 
- XXX_EXTERNAL
    - If NO then build the source code for this library in ADSupport. 
    - If YES then this library is installed external to areaDetector 
- XXX_INCLUDE
    - If ``XXX_EXTERNAL=YES`` then this is the path to the include files for
      XXX. However, if XXX is a system library whose include files are in a
      standard include search path then do not define ``XXX_INCLUDE``. 
- XXX_LIB
    - If ``XXX_EXTERNAL=YES`` then this is the path to the library files for
      XXX. However, if XXX is a system library whose library files in a
      standard library search path then do not define ``XXX_LIB``.

XML2 is an exception. It is required, so WITH_XML2 is not supported, but
``XML2_EXTERNAL``, ``XML2_INCLUDE``, and ``XML2_LIB`` are supported.

Note that there are some library interdependencies. 

- If ``WITH_TIFF=YES`` then ``WITH_ZLIB`` must also be ``YES``. 
- If ``WITH_HDF5=YES`` then ``WITH_ZLIB`` and ``WITH_SZIP`` must also be ``YES``. 
- If ``WITH_NEXUS=YES`` then ``WITH_HDF5`` must also be ``YES``.

``CONFIG_SITE.local`` contains the following lines at the end:

::

   # The definitions above can be overridden in the following files.
   # The files are searched in this order, with the last definition being used.
   #    CONFIG_SITE.local.$(OS_CLASS)
   #    CONFIG_SITE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) 
   #    CONFIG_SITE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

Thus if multiple architectures are being built in the same tree the
settings can be different for each ``OS_CLASS``, ``EPICS_HOST_ARCH``, or
``EPICS_HOST_ARCH.T_A``.

Edit RELEASE.local
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uncomment the lines for the drivers that should be built. None of the
detector drivers are included by default. Some detectors cannot be built
on all systems. For example the Roper driver can only be built on
Windows systems with the Princeton Instruments WinView or WinSpec
programs installed, and the Point Grey driver can currently only be
built on Linux systems if the version of libc.so is 2.14 or greater.

``RELEASE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)`` can be used to build different drivers
on different ``EPICS_HOST_ARCH`` builds in the same tree.

make
~~~~

Just type:

::

   make

If this fails then some required products have probably not been
installed.

Example files in ADCore/iocBoot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy ``EXAMPLE_commonPlugins.cmd`` to ``commonPlugins.cmd`` and
``EXAMPLE_commonPlugin_settings.req`` to ``commonPlugin_settings.req``.

::

   cp EXAMPLE_commonPlugins.cmd           commonPlugins.cmd
   cp EXAMPLE_commonPlugin_settings.req   commonPlugin_settings.req

Edit ``commonPlugins.cmd`` and ``commonPlugin_settings.req``. Change whether or
not the lines for optional modules (e.g. DEVIOCSTATS, ALIVE) are
commented out depending on whether these modules were defined in
``RELEASE_PRODS.local``.

Run SimDetector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   cd ADSimDetector/iocs/simDetectorIOC/iocBoot/iocSimDetector
   ### Edit Makefile to set ARCH to your $(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) architecture
   make
   ../../bin/linux-x86_64/simDetectorApp st.cmd

   ### If you want to be able to easily run Linux and Windows in the same tree do the following:
   ###   Set ARCH in Makefile for Linux, run make on the Linux machine, and copy envPaths to envPaths.linux
   ###   Set ARCH in Makefile for Windows, run make on the Windows machine, and copy envPaths to envPaths.windows
   ### Start the IOC for Linux:
   ../../bin/linux-x86_64/simDetectorApp st.cmd.linux
   ### Start the IOC for Windows:
   ../../bin/windows-x64/simDetectorApp st.cmd.windows

Installing Pre-Built Binary Versions of areaDetector
----------------------------------------------------

Pre-built binary versions of areaDetector can be provided for each
detector. This is provided as a convenience so that it is not necessary
to set up a build system to run areaDetector on a specific detector.

The instructions here use the Pilatus (ADPilatus) module as an example.
Substitute Pilatus with the name of the detector you are working with.

The pre-built binaries can be found on the `CARS Web
site <https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/pub/>`__. There is a
subdirectory there for each detector (e.g. ADPilatus) that contains
releases for that detector. If you don’t see a pre-built package for the
detector you are looking for send an e-mail to Mark Rivers and I can
create one for you.

The pre-built binaries contain executables for one or more of the
following architectures: 

- linux-x86 (32-bit Linux built on Centos7, gcc 4.8.5, libc 2.17) 
- linux-x86_64 (64-bit Linux built on Centos7, gcc 4.8.5, libc 2.17) 
- linux-x86_rhel6 (32-bit Linux build on RHEL6, gcc 4.4.7, libc 2.12) 
- linux-x86_64-gcc42 (64-bit Linux built on SUSE, gcc 4.2.1, libc 2.6.1) 
- darwin-x86 (64-bit Mac OS X built on Darwin 11.4.2, ??, clang 4.2) 
- win32-x86-static (32-bit Windows, VS2010 compiler, statically linked) 
- win32-x86 (32-bit Windows, VX2010 compiler, dyanamically linked) 
- windows-x64-static (64-bit Windows, VS2010 compiler, statically linked) 
- windows-x64 (64-bit Windows, VX2010 compiler, dyanamically linked)

Note that the linux-x86 and linux-x86_64 builds are done a relatively
new Linux system and will not run on RHEL 6, for example. The
linux-x86-rhel6 build will run on RHEL 6. The linux-x86_64-gcc42 build
uses a very old version of libc and should run on most Linux systems.

Follow these steps to use the prebuilt version.

-  Create an installation directory for the module. On Windows I
   typically use ``C:\EPICS\support``. On Linux I
   typically use ``/home/ACCOUNT/epics/support``, where ``ACCOUNT`` 
   is the name of the account that is normally used to run the detector 
   software, e.g. marccd on a marCCD detector, mar345 on a mar345 
   detector, det on a Pilatus detector, etc.

-  Place the distribution file in this directory. Then issue the
   commands (Unix style)

   ``tar xvzf ADPilatus_RX-Y.tgz``

   On Windows it is more convenient to download the zip file and extract
   it using Windows Explorer.

-  In the ``ADPilatus/iocs/pilatusIOC/iocBoot/`` directory make a *copy* of
   the example ``iocPilatus`` directory and give it a new local name,
   e.g. ioc13Pilatus1. By doing this you will be able to update to later
   versions of areaDetector without overwriting modifications you make
   in the ``ioc13Pilatus1`` directory.

-  In the new ``io13Pilatus1`` directory you just created edit st.cmd to
   change the PV prefix ``$(PREFIX)`` to one that is unique to your site. PV
   prefixes must be unique on the subnet, and if you use the default
   prefix there could be a conflict with other detectors of the same
   type.

-  In the same ``ioc13Pilatus1`` directory edit the file envPaths to point
   to the locations of all of the support modules on your system.
   Normally this is handled by the EPICS build system, but when using
   the prebuilt version this must be manually edited. Do not worry about
   the path to ``EPICS_BASE``, it is not required.

Display Managers
----------------

A display manager is needed to view the areaDetector control screens.
Control screens are provided for the following display managers: MEDM,
EDM, CSS, and caQtDM. The native screens are created manually using
MEDM. The EDM, CSS and caQtDM screens are converted from the MEDM
screens using conversion utilities. These are discussed in a later
section.

In order to control the detectors and the plugins you should install one
or more of MEDM, EDM, CSS, caQtDM.

MEDM
~~~~

This can be downloaded through links on the `MEDM home
page <https://epics.anl.gov/extensions/medm/index.php>`__.

This requires `Motif <http://motif.ics.com/>`__. MEDM can be built from

Configuration
-------------

Before running an areaDetector application it is usually necessary to
configure a number of items.

-  EPICS environment variables. There are several environment variables
   that EPICS uses. I suggest setting these in the .cshrc (or .bashrc)
   file for the account that will be used to run the detector.

   -  ``EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST`` and ``EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST``. These variables
      control the IP addresses that EPICS clients use when searching for
      EPICS PVs. The default is ``EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=YES`` and
      ``EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST`` to be the broadcast address of all networks
      connected to the host. Some detectors, for example the marCCD and
      mar345, come with 2 network cards, which are on 2 different
      subnets, typically a private one connected to the detector and a
      public one connected to the local LAN. If the default value of
      these variables is used then EPICS clients ( e.g. medm) running on
      the detector host computer will generate many errors because each
      EPICS PV will appear to be coming from both networks. The solution
      is to set these variables as follows:

      ``setenv EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST NO``

      ``setenv EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST localhost:XX.YY.ZZ.255``

      where XX.YY.ZZ.255 should be replaced with the broadcast address
      for the public network on this computer.

   -    ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES``. This variable controls the maximum
        array size that EPICS can transmit with Channel Access. The
        default is only 16kB, which is much too small for most detector
        data. This value must be set to a large enough value on both the
        EPICS server computer (e.g. the one running the areaDetector
        IOC) and client computer (e.g. the one running medm, ImageJ,
        IDL, etc.). This should be set to a value that is larger than
        the largest waveform record that will be used for the detector.
        For example if using a detector with 1024x1024 pixels and
        4-bytes per pixel (waveform record FTVL=LONG) then
        ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES`` would need to be at least 1024 \* 1024
        \* 4 = 4153344.
        In practice it should be set at least 100 bytes larger than this
        because there is some overhead. For example:

        ``setenv EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES 4154000``

        Do not simply set ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES`` to a very large number
        like 100MB or 1GB. EPICS Channel Access allocates buffers of
        exactly ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY`` bytes whenever the required buffer size
        exceeds 16 kB, and one does not want unnecessarily large buffers
        to be allocated.

   -  ``EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH``. This variable controls where medm looks for
      .adl display files. If the recommendation below is followed to
      copy all adl files to a single directory, then this environment
      variable should be defined to point to that directory. For
      example:

      ``setenv EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH /home/det/epics/adls``

-  medm display files. It is convenient to copy all medm .adl files to a
   single directory and then point the environment variable
   ``EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH`` to this directory. The alternative is to point
   ``EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH`` to a long list of directories where the adl files
   are located in the distributions, which is harder to maintain. On the
   Pilatus, for example, create a directory called ``/home/det/epics/adls``,
   and put all of the adl files there. To simplify copying the adl files
   to that location use the following one-line script, which can be
   placed in ``/home/det/bin/sync_adls``.

   ``find /home/det/epics/support -name '*.adl' -exec cp -fv {} /home/det/epics/adls \;``

   This script finds all adl files in the ``epics/support`` tree and copies
   them to ``/home/det/epics/adls``. That directory must be created before
   running this script. Similar scripts can be used for other Linux
   detectors (marCCD, mar345, etc.) and can be used on Windows as well
   if Cygwin is installed. Each time a new release of areaDetector is
   installed remove the old versions of each support module
   (areaDetector, asyn, autosave, etc.) and then run this script to
   install the latest medm files.

Running the IOC Application
---------------------------

Each example IOC directory comes with a Linux script (start_epics) or a
Windows batch file (start_epics.bat) or both depending on the
architectures that the detector runs on. These scripts provide simple
examples of how to start medm and the EPICS IOC. For example, for the
mar345 ``iocBoot/iocMAR345/start_epics`` contains the following:

::

   medm -x -macro "P=13MAR345_1:, R=cam1:" mar345.adl &
   ../../bin/linux-x86/mar345App st.cmd

This script starts medm in execute mode with the appropriate medm
display file and macro parameters, running it in the background. It then
runs the IOC application. This script assumes that ``iocBoot/iocMAR345`` is
the default directory when it is run, which could be added to the
command or set in the configuration if this script is set as the target
of a desktop shortcut, etc. The script assumes that ``EPICS_DISPLAY_PATH``
has been defined to be a location where the ``mar345.adl`` and related
displays that it loads can be found. You will need to edit the script in
your copy of the iocXXX directory to change the prefix (P) from
``13MAR345_1:`` to whatever prefix you chose for your IOC. The start_epics
script could also be copied to a location in your PATH (e.g.
``/home/mar345/bin/start_epics``). Add a command like

::

   cd /home/mar345/epics/support/areaDetector-2-0/ADmar345/iocs/mar345IOC/iocBoot/iocMAR345

at the beginning of the script and then type

::

   start_epics

from any directory to start the EPICS IOC.

Image Viewers
-------------

The `areaDetector/ADViewers
repository <https://github.com/areaDetector/ADViewers>`__ comes with
tools to display images over EPICS Channel Access using ImageJ and IDL.
These viewers are described in
:doc:`ADViewers/ad_viewers`

HDFView can be used to view files saved with the HDF5 file writing
plugins. ImageJ can also be used to view files saved with the TIFF,
JPEG, and netCDF plugins.
