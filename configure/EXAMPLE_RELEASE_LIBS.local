#RELEASE Location of external products
# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application
# top directory each time this file is changed.

# If using Debian packages then the following must be done:
#  SUPPORT should be defined to be the root location of any modules which should NOT come from the Debian package.
#  Any modules which should come from the Debian package should be commented out, except for EPICS_BASE.
#  For example to use a newer version of asyn and areaDetector then define ASYN, AREA_DETECTOR, ADCORE,
#  and ADSUPPORT here.  To use the Debian version of asyn then comment out ASYN here.

# If you don't want to install into $(TOP) then
# define INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

SUPPORT=/corvette/home/epics/devel

# ASYN is needed for base classes 
ASYN=$(SUPPORT)/asyn-4-45

AREA_DETECTOR=$(SUPPORT)/areaDetector-3-14

# ADSupport is needed by ADCore plugins
ADSUPPORT=$(AREA_DETECTOR)/ADSupport

# ADCORE for base classes and plugins
ADCORE=$(AREA_DETECTOR)/ADCore

EPICS_BASE=/corvette/usr/local/epics-devel/base-7.0.8

# If CONFIG_SITE.local defines WITH_PVA=YES and EPICS_BASE is prior to 7.0 then define the path here
# If using EPICS_BASE 7.0 or later the PVA files are in base itself and no additional definitions are needed.
#PVA=/corvette/usr/local/epics-devel/epicsV4/EPICS-CPP-4.6.0

# PVA modules
# For versions prior to EPICS base 7.0 use this
#PVCOMMON=$(PVA)/pvCommonCPP
#PVACCESS=$(PVA)/pvAccessCPP
#PVDATA=$(PVA)/pvDataCPP
#PVDATABASE=$(PVA)/pvDatabaseCPP
#NORMATIVETYPES=$(PVA)/normativeTypesCPP
