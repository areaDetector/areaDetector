Overview
--------

This plugin converts NDArray data produced by asynNDArrayDrivers into
the EPICSv4 normative type NTNDArray. An embedded EPICSv4 server is
created to serve the new NTNDArray structure as an EPICSv4 PV. A
`description <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypesNDArray.html>`__
of the structure of the NTNDArray normative type is available.

NDPluginPva defines the following parameters.

.. cssclass:: table-bordered table-striped table-hover
.. flat-table::
  :header-rows: 2
  :widths: 5 5 5 70 5 5 5

Configuration
-------------

The NDPluginPva plugin is created with the ``NDPvaConfigure`` command,
either from C/C++ or from the EPICS IOC shell.

::

   NDPvaConfigure (const char *portName, int queueSize, int blockingCallbacks,
                         const char *NDArrayPort, int NDArrayAddr, const char *pvName,
                         size_t maxMemory, int priority, int stackSize)
     

For details on the meaning of the parameters to this function refer to
the detailed documentation on the NDPvaConfigure function in the
`NDPluginPva.cpp
documentation <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_n_d_plugin_pva_8cpp.html>`__ and
in the documentation for the constructor for the `NDPluginPva
class <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_plugin_pva.html>`__.

The following MEDM screen for the NDPluginPva. The only item not in the
base class screen is the readback of the EPICS V4 PV name.

Starting the pvAccess server
----------------------------

In order to actually serve the EPICSv4 PV created by this plugin it is
necessary to call ``startPVAServer``.

Anedoctal Performance Numbers
-----------------------------

A performance test was conducted at NSLS-II to evaluate the benefits of
using NDPva instead of NDStdArrays to transport images for visualization
purposes. Eight AVT cameras of four different models were used:

.. cssclass:: table-bordered table-striped table-hover
.. flat-table::
  :header-rows: 2

  * - Model
    - Resolution
    - Frame Rate
  * - Manta G125B (3 instances)
    - 1292x964x1
    - 30 Hz
  * - GT2450 (3 instances)
    - 2448x2050x1
    - 15 Hz
  * - GT3400C (1 instance)
    - 3384x2704x3 (binned to 1692x1352x3)
    - 17 Hz
  * - Mako G131C (1 instance)
    - 1280x1024x3
    - 28 Hz

All camera IOCs were concurrently running and acquiring on a HP ProLiant
DL360 Gen9 server with 32GB of memory and a 12-core Xeon E5-2620 @ 2.40
GHz CPU. No other resource intensive process was running during the
tests. This server was connected to a switch via a 10Gbps fiber link, as
was the client computer. All cameras were individually connected via
1Gbps copper links to the switch. The client computer was a HP Z640
Workstation with 32GB of memory and 12-core Xeon E5-1650 @ 3.5GHz CPU,
running CS-Studio version 4.3.3. Five tests were performed:

- **Baseline:** Cameras acquiring, no plugins enabled
- **NDPva, no CS-Studio:** Cameras acquiring, only NDPva enabled,
  images not being displayed in CS-Studio
- **NDPva + CS-Studio:** Cameras acquiring, only NDPva enabled, images
  being displayed in CS-Studio
- **NDStdArrays, no CS-Studio:** Cameras acquiring, only NDStdArrays
  enabled, images not being displayed in CS-Studio
- **NDStdArrays + CS-Studio:** Cameras acquiring, only NDStdArrays
  enabled, images being displayed in CS-Studio

The results of these tests are tabulated as follows:
