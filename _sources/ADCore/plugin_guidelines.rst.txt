Guidelines and rules for plugins
================================

The following are guidelines and rules for writing plugins

-  Plugins will almost always implement the ``processCallbacks()`` function.
   This function will be called with an NDArray pointer each time an
   NDArray callback occurs. This function will normally call the
   ``NDPluginDriver::processCallbacks()`` base class function, which handles
   tasks common to all plugins, including callbacks with information
   about the array, etc.
-  Plugins will generally implement one or more of the ``writeInt32()``,
   ``writeFloat64()`` or ``writeOctet()`` functions if they need to act
   immediately on a new value of a parameter. For many parameters it is
   normally sufficient to simply have them written to the parameter
   library, and not to handle them in the writeXXX() functions. The
   parameters are then retrieved from the parameter library with the
   ``getIntParam()``, ``getDoubleParam()``, or ``getStringParam()`` function calls
   when they are needed.
-  If the ``writeInt32()``, ``writeFloat64()`` or ``writeOctet()`` functions are
   implemented they **must** call the base class function for parameters
   that they do not handle and whose parameter index value is less than
   the first parameter of this class, i.e. parameters that belong to a
   base class.
-  Plugins will need to call the ``createParam()`` function in their
   constructor if they have additional parameters beyond those in the
   asynPortDriver or NDPluginDriver base classes.
-  Plugins may **never** modify the NDArray that they receive in the
   ``processCallbacks()`` function. The reason is that other plugins may be
   concurrently operating on the same NDArray, since each is passed the
   same pointer. This means also that when getting the attributes for
   this plugin that
   ``asynNDArrayDriver::getAttributes(pArray->pAttributeList)`` must not be
   called with the NDArray passed to ``processCallbacks()``, because that
   will modify the NDArray attribute list, and hence the NDArray that
   other plugins are operating on. Plugins such as NDPluginROI and
   NDPluginColorConvert create new NDArrays via ``NDArrayPool::copy()`` or
   ``NDArrayPool::convert()`` (which copy the attributes to the new array)
   and then call ``getAttributes(pArray->pAttributeList)`` with the new
   array.
-  Plugins must release their mutex by calling ``this->unlock()`` when they
   do time-consuming operations. If they do not then they will not be
   able to queue new NDArrays callbacks or obtain new parameter values.
   Obviously they must not access memory locations that other threads
   could modify during this time, so they should only access local
   variables, not class variables (which includes the parameter
   library).
-  If plugins generate new or modified NDArrays then they must call
   ``NDPluginDriver::doNDArrayCallbacks()`` so that registered clients can
   get the values of the new arrays.
