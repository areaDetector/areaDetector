Overview
--------

NDPluginCodec is a tool for compressing and decomppressing NDArray data
according to a user selectable codec. Compression information is stored
in the ``codec`` and ``compressionSize`` fields of the NDArray.

Compressed NDArray Semantics
----------------------------

The new NDArray field ``codec`` is used to indicate if an NDArray holds
compressed or uncompressed data.

Uncompressed NDArrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``codec`` is empty (``codec.empty()==true``).
-  ``compressedSize`` is equal to ``dataSize``.

Compressed NDArrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``codec.name`` holds the name of the codec that was used to compress the
   data. This plugin currently supports four codecs: "jpeg", "blosc", "lz4", and "bzlz4".
-  ``compressedSize`` holds the length of the compressed data in
   ``pData``.
-  ``dataSize`` holds the length of the allocated ``pData`` buffer, as
   usual.
-  ``pData`` holds the compressed data as ``unsigned char``.
-  ``dataType`` holds the data type of the **uncompressed** data. This
   will be used for decompression.

Compression
-----------

To compress the data, the Mode parameter must be set to Compress. Also,
the parameter Compressor must be set to something other than None. After
the compression is done, the CompFactor parameter will be updated with
the compression factor achieved. CompFactor is calculated according to
the following formula:

``dataSize/compressedSize``

Currently, five choices are available for the Compressor parameter:

-  None: No compression will be performed. The NDArray will be passed
   forward as-is.
-  JPEG: The compression will be performed according to the JPEG format.
   ``pData`` will contain a full, valid JPEG file in memory after the
   compression is done. JPEG compression is limited to unsigned 8-bit data (UInt8).
   It is also limited to ColorMode=Mono or RGB1.  For Mono the input data is
   2-D (NX, NY).  For RGB1 it is 3-D [3, NX, NY].
   JPEG compression is controlled with the following parameters:

   -  JPEGQuality: The image quality to be used for the compression. The
      quality value must be between 1 and 100, with 100 meaning best
      quality (and worst compression factor).

-  Blosc: The compression will be performed according to the Blosc
   format. The compression is controlled via the following parameters:

   -  BloscCompressor: which compression algorithm to use. Available
      choices: BloscLZ, LZ4, LZ4HC, Snappy, ZLIB and ZSTD.
   -  BloscCLevel: the compression level for the selected algorithm.
   -  BloscShuffle: controls whether data will be shuffled before
      compression. Choices are None, Byte, and Bit.
   -  BloscNumThreads: controls how many threads will be used by the
      Blosc compressor to improve performance.
-  LZ4: The compression will be performed according to the LZ4
   format. This is similar to the Blosc compressor with BloscShuffle=None
   but uses the native LZ4 library, rather than Blosc.
   It is one of the compressors used on the ZeroMQ socket interface on 
   the Eiger detector from Dectris. NDPluginCodec can thus be used to decompress
   this data.
-  BSLZ4: The compression will be performed according to the Bitshuffle/LZ4
   format. This is similar to the Blosc compressor with BloscShuffle=Bit
   but uses the native LZ4 library, rather than Blosc.
   It is one of the compressors used on the ZeroMQ socket interface on 
   the Eiger detector from Dectris. NDPluginCodec can thus be used to decompress
   this data.

Note that BloscNumThreads controls the number of threads created from a
single NDPluginCodec thread. The performance of all the
compressors can also be increased by running multiple NDPluginCodec
threads within a single plugin instance. This is controlled with the
NumThreads record, as for most other plugins.

It is important to note that plugins downstream of NDCodec that are
receiving compressed NDArrays **must** have been constructed with
NDPluginDriver's ``compressionAware=true``, otherwise compressed arrays
**will be dropped** by them at runtime. Currently only NDPluginCodec,
NDPluginPva, and NDFileHDF5 are able to handle compressed NDArrays.

Decompression
-------------

If Mode is set to Decompress, decompression happens automatically and
transparently if the codec is supported. No other parameter needs to be
set for the decompression to work.

Parameters
----------

NDPluginCodec inherits from NDPluginDriver. The `NDPluginCodec class
documentation <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_plugin_codec.html>`__
describes this class in detail.

NDPluginCodec defines the following parameters. It also implements all
of the standard plugin parameters from
:doc:`NDPluginDriver`. The EPICS database
NDCodec.template provides access to these parameters, listed in the
following table.

Configuration
-------------

The NDPluginCodec plugin is created with the following command, either
from C/C++ or from the EPICS IOC shell.

::

    int NDCodecConfigure(const char *portName, int queueSize, int blockingCallbacks,
                                const char *NDArrayPort, int NDArrayAddr,
                                int maxBuffers, size_t maxMemory,
                                int priority, int stackSize)
     

For details on the meaning of the parameters to this function refer to
the detailed documentation on the NDCodecConfigure function in the
`NDPluginCodec.cpp
documentation <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_n_d_plugin_codec_8cpp.html>`__
and in the documentation for the constructor for the `NDPluginCodec
class <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_plugin_codec.html>`__.

Screen shots

The following is the MEDM screen that provides access to the parameters
in NDPluginDriver.h and NDPluginCodec.h through records in
NDPluginBase.template and NDCodec.template.

Performance
-----------

The following screens show the performance that can be achieved with
NDPluginCodec. For this test the simDetector driver was generating
1024x1024 UInt32 arrays at ~1280 arrays/s. These were compressed using
Blosc LZ4 compression with Bit shuffle and 6 Blosc threads. The
compression factor was ~42, so the output arrays were 98 KB, compared to
the input size of 4 MB. When running with a single plugin thread
(NumThreads=1) the plugin sometimes could not keep up. By increasing
numThreads to 2 the plugin could always process the full 1280 arrays/s
without dropping any arrays. The test was run on a 20-core Linux
machine, and the simDetector IOC was using ~7 cores. NDPluginCodec was
using ~6 of these. Since each array is 4 MB, this is a compression rate
of ~5.0 GB/s, or about 5 times the capacity of 10 Gbit Ethernet.
