Introduction
------------

This is an `EPICS <http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/>`__
`areaDetector <areaDetector.html>`__ driver that allows any EPICS
Channel Access client to create NDArrays in an areaDetector IOC. It is
the logical inverse of the
`NDPluginStdArrays <NDPluginStdArrays.html>`__, which converts NDArrays
in an IOC into standard EPICS waveform records for use by Channel Access
clients. The NDPluginStdArrays plugin also writes to additional records
to describe the array structure. The NDDriverStdArrays driver receives
EPICS waveform records from Channel Access clients and converts them to
an NDArray in the IOC. The clients must also write to additional EPICS
records to define the structure of the NDArray. It is similar in concept
to the `pvaDriver <pvaDriverDoc.html>`__ which receives EPICS V4
NTNDArrays over the network and converts them to NDArrays in the IOC.
pvaDriver only works with EPICS V4 PVAccess clients, while
NDDriverStdArrays works with EPICS V3 Channel Access clients.

NDDriverStdArrays is based on an earlier driver called ADSoft written by
David Vine from LBNL. This driver generalizes ADSoft to support any
number of dimensions and any input waveform data type.

One use-case for this driver may be to receive data from the EPICS sscan
record. By putting such data into an areaDetector IOC it could then be
saved with the standard file saving plugins. It could also be processed
with ROI plugins, and then visualized with the standard areaDetector
viewers like ImageJ.

This driver inherits from `ADDriver <areaDetectorDoc.html#ADDriver>`__.
It implements many of the parameters in
`asynNDArrayDriver.h <areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html>`__
and in
`ADArrayDriver.h <areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html>`__. It
also implements a number of parameters that are specific to this driver.
The `NDDriverStdArrays class
documentation <areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_driver_std_arrays.html>`__
describes this class in detail.

The driver receives 1-D arrays, normally from an EPICS waveform record.
The NDimensions record controls the actual number of dimensions to use
when creating the NDArray. The Dimensions array record controls the
actual size of each of the NDimensions dimensions. The only limit on the
number of dimensions is the ND\_ARRAY\_MAX\_DIMENSIONS value defined in
ADCore. This is normally 10. The ColorMode record can be used to define
the color mode (Mono, Bayer, RGB1, RGB2, or RGB3) of the NDArray. This
does not affect the operation of the driver, so the data in the waveform
record must be in the correct order for the specified color mode.

The data type of the NDArray is controlled by the DataType record. It
can be any of the datatypes Int8, UInt8, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32,
Float32, or Float64. The datatype (FTVL) of the EPICS waveform record
can also be any of the types CHAR, UCHAR, SHORT, USHORT, LONG, ULONG,
FLOAT, or DOUBLE. The DTYP of the waveform record can be any of
asynInt8ArrayWfOut, asynInt16ArrayWfOut, asynInt32ArrayWfOut,
asynFloat32ArrayWfOut, or asynFloat64ArrayWfOut. The driver does any
required type conversion between the waveform record data and the
NDArray data.

The driver has 2 modes of operation, AppendMode=Disable and
AppendMode=Enable. When AppendMode is Disable then each write to the
waveform record will generate a complete NDArray. The first element of
the waveform record will be placed in the first element of the NDArray.
Generally the number of elements written should be equal to the total
number of elements in the NDArray. If it is greater then excess elements
will be discarded. If it is fewer then the NDArray will be zero-padded.

When AppendMode=Enable then the waveform record can contain just part of
the NDArray data, and data can be appended by multiple writes to the
waveform record to construct the complete NDArray. In append mode the
following records are used to control the operation of the driver. These
records have no effect if AppendMode=Disable.

-  NewArray This record must be processed before sending data for a new
   NDArray.
-  NextElement This record can be used to define the location in the
   NDArray in which to write the data on the next waveform record write.
   It is set to 0 when NewArray is processed, and is incremented by the
   number of elements in the waveform record each time the waveform
   record is written. Thus if the data are being written in the logical
   order of the NDArray then this record does not need to be written.
   This record is useful when the should not be written in the natural
   order of the NDArray data.
-  Stride This record can be used to define the increment in the NDArray
   index for each successive element in the waveform record. Data is
   copied from the waveform record to the NDArray as follows:

   ::

               NDArray[NextElement + i*Stride] = waveform[i]
           

   The default value of Stride is 1.

-  ArrayComplete This record must be processed to tell the driver that
   the NDArray is complete and that no more waveform records will be
   written to this NDArray.

The CallbackMode record controls when the driver does callbacks to
plugins. In append mode it may not be desireable to do callbacks each
time the waveform record is written, since that could happen thousands
of times per second if only small parts of the NDArray are written on
each call. The CallbackMode record has 3 choices:

-  OnUpdate The callbacks will be done each time the NDArray is updated,
   i.e. each time the waveform record is written.
-  OnComplete The callbacks will be done when the NDArray is complete.
   This is equivalent to OnUpdate when AppendMode=Disable, but when
   AppendMode=Enable then the callbacks will only happen after the
   ArrayComplete record is processed.
-  OnCommand The callbacks are only called when the DoCallbacks record
   is processed. This allows Channel Access clients to control when the
   callbacks are done. The DoCallbacks record will also cause the
   callbacks to be done when CallbackMode is OnUpdate or OnComplete.

Standard areaDetector parameters
--------------------------------

The following table describes how the NDDriverStdArrays driver
implements some of the standard driver parameters. The Acquire,
ImageMode, NumImages, ImageCounter, and ArrayCallbacks records are
handled in the standard way. The trigger, temperature, acquire time, and
gain related records are not implemented.

Configuration
-------------

The NDDriverStdArrays driver is created with the NDDriverStdArraysConfig
command, either from C/C++ or from the EPICS IOC shell::

    NDDriverStdArraysConfig(const char *portName,
                  int maxBuffers, size_t maxMemory, 
                  int priority, int stackSize)
      

There an example IOC boot directory and startup script
(`iocBoot/iocNDDriverStdArrays/st.cmd) <nd_std_arrays_st_cmd.html>`__
provided with areaDetector.

Unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~

The src/Python\_tests and src/IDL\_tests directories contain a number of
tests of the driver. The IDL tests are run by opening IDL and typing for
example:

::

    IDL> .run MonoOverwrite
        

The Python tests can all be run by typing:

::

    python test_NDDriverStdArrays.py
        

Individual tests can be run by typing for example:

::

    python test_NDDriverStdArrays.py TestNDDriverStdArrays.testDataTypes
      

When running the tests it is useful to be displaying the images, for
example in ImageJ. It is helpful to press the ImageJ "Auto" contrast
button as the tests are run, since they have different data ranges.

test\_NDDriverStdArrays.py contains the following tests:

-  **testDataTypes** This test creates NDArrays of size 256x768 for each
   allowed NDArray data type and corresponding Python data type. It
   writes the complete array with a single channel access write to the
   waveform record, i.e. with AppendMode=Disable. After writing each
   array it reads it back to verify that the data read matches the data
   written.
-  **testDataTypesAppend** This test is the same as testDataTypes except
   that the data are written with AppendMode=Enable. Each channel access
   write to the waveform record writes "ystep" rows of the image.
   "ystep" is set to 1 in the code, but can be edited to test writing
   multiple rows at once. After writing each complete array it reads it
   back to verify that the data read matches the data written.
-  **testContinuousMono** This test writes 50 NDArrays of size 500x800
   with ImageMode=Continuous, ColorMode=Mono, and AppendMode=Disable.
   The images are a 2-D damped sine wave, where the frequency increases
   with each successive image. After writing each complete array it
   reads it back to verify that the data read matches the data written.
-  **testContinuousRGB1** This test writes 20 NDArrays of size 3x600x800
   with ImageMode=Continuous ColorMode=RGB1, and AppendMode=Disable. The
   images are a 2-D damped sine wave, where the frequency increases with
   each successive image and where the red, green, and blue images have
   different frequencies. After writing each complete array it reads it
   back to verify that the data read matches the data written.
-  **testScanPoint** This test simulates collecting 2-D scan data for 4
   detectors with size 100x200. The data are collected with
   AppendMode=Enable. The data are appended to the NDArray one "pixel"
   at a time, i.e. the waveform record is has 4 elements, one for each
   detector. At the end of the scan the test configures the ROI1: plugin
   to select each of the 4 detectors in turn and processes the
   DoCallbacks record. This can display each of the detectors in
   succession in the ImageJ plugin, for example.
-  **testScanPointReverse** This is the same as testScanPoint except
   that the data are collected in reverse order, i.e. from element
   [99,199] backwards to element [0,0]. It thus tests the use of
   NextElement.
-  **testScanLine** This test simulates collecting 2-D scan data for 4
   detectors with size 400x600. The data are collected with
   AppendMode=Enable. The data are appended to the NDArray one "detector
   line" at a time, i.e. the waveform record is has 400 elements,
   containing the data for one detector for one row of the scan. The
   NDArray can be one of the following shapes:

   -  [4,400,600] This is "detector interleaved", and called
      detIndex=0.  This is the default.
   -  [400,4,600] This is "row interleaved", and called detIndex=1.
   -  [400,600,4] This is "plane interleaved", and called detIndex=2.

   At the end of the scan the test configures the ROI1: plugin to select
   each of the 4 detectors in turn and processes the DoCallbacks record.
   This can display each of the detectors in succession in the ImageJ
   plugin, for example.
-  **testScanLineIndex1** This is the same as testScanLine, but with
   detIndex=1.
-  **testScanLineIndex2**\ This is the same as testScanLine, but with
   detIndex=2.

The following shows the NDPluginROI medm screen configured to select the
4'th detector in the NDArray. Note that the plugin has the CollapseDims
PV enabled. This results in output arrays of dimensions [100, 200],
rather than [1, 100, 200] which would be the case if CollapseDims was
disabled.

detector via ROI4. The NDPluginStdArrays was set to have ROI4 as its
array input.
