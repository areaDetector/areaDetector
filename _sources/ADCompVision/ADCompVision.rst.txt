Installing the plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADCompVision plugin depends on several external libraries. These
include:

-  Opencv: Can be built from source from
   `github <https://github.com/opencv/opencv>`__. Otherwise install from
   package manager.
-  EPICS, Area Detector, and their submodules, all of whuch can be found
   on github.

Further installation instructions are located in the README.md file in
the top level of
`this <https://github.com/epicsNSLS2-areaDetector/ADCompVision>`__
repository.

--------------

Using ADCompVision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin allows for a multitude of Open Computer Vision functions. As
a result, each function will use the input/output PVs differently.

| To view how each function uses the inputs and outputs view the manual
  `here. <ADCompVisionManual.html>`__
| In addition, selecting an option from the dropdown menu will populate
  the input and output descriptions for any that are used by the
  selected CV function.

The main CSS screen for the ADCompVision plugin looks as follows:

|main|

To use the plugin, you must select one of the functions from the three
function sets. The other 2 function sets must be set to 'None' Then,
make sure that the image1 or pv1 plugin has its input port set to be the
output port of ADCompVision (CV1). You should pass CV1 to whichever
plugin you use to display your images. Then, open the main screen, and
note that input and output descriptions are listed for each function.
Enter valid input values for each of the required inputs. Next, start
image acquisition and enable the plugin. You should see the processed
image in image1 ArrayData. Some examples are shown below.

When using non-8bit cameras, note that many of the CompVision functions
supported here require the input image to be downconverted to 8 bit in
order to work. To do this, select your camera's actual bit depth in the
bit depth selector. (NOT NDDataType). If your device is a 12 bit camera
for example, select 12 bit in the menu, not 16 bit, even if the input
has an NDDataType of NDUInt16.

Usage Examples:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Thresholding**

|Thresholding|

As of R1-0 ADCompVision supports Thresholding. Start by selecting it
from the Vision Function 1 dropdown menu. Set the threshold value and
max pixel value. The max pixel value will almost always be 255 on 8 bit
images.

**Laplacian Edge Detection**

|Laplacian|

As of R1-0 ADCompVision supports Laplacian based edge detection. Start
by selecting it from the Vision Function 1 dropdown menu. Set the blur
degree, kernel size, scale, and delta. Note that the blur degree and
kernel size must be odd integers from 1 to 15 (3 usually works best).
Tweak these parameters until an acceptable result is visible.

**Canny edge detection**

|Canny|

As of R1-0 ADCompVision supports Canny based edge detection. Start by
selecting it from the Vision Function 1 dropdown menu. Set the Threshold
value, ratio, blur degree, and kernel size, note that the blur degree
and kernel size must be odd integers from 1 to 15 (3 usually works
best). Tweak these parameters until an acceptable result is visible.

**Centroid identification**

|Centroid|

As of R1-0 ADCompVision supports centroid identification. To use this
feature select it from the Function set 2 dropdown. Then, set the number
of desired objects to find, the blur degree (3 or 5 is usually best), a
threshold value, and an upper and lower pixel area threshold for the
objects. Play around with these numbers until the desired objects are
detected. The centroid centers are then outputted into the 'Output' PV
values

**Video Record**

|Video Record|

As of R1-2, ADCompVision supports writing video recordings for
areaDetector. Controls allow for setting an output framerate, color and
mono video, 4 different encoding formats, and 2 file formats. To start a
recording, input a valid file path, then enter valid options for
framerate and other video modes. Finally simply enter a '1' into the
'Start/Stop' field to start recording, and a '0' to stop recording. The
video will be saved to the given file path and will be called
CV\_Output\_Vid\_$TIMESTAMP.avi or .mp4 depending on selection. Note
that not all 4 encodings will be supported on each machine.

**Distance Check**

|Dist Check|

As of R1-2, ADCompVision supports Distance Checking between two objects
in an image. To use this feature, select it from Function set 3. Then
enter a distance threshold in pixels, then a blur size (3 or 5 are
usually best), a threshold value, select apply blur = yes (will give
better results), and choose an object size threshold in pixels to avoid
background noise. Tweak the threshold and size values until the two
desired objects are detected, and then note that the output pvs print
the pixel distance between them, and whether or not it is under the
distance threshold input variable.
