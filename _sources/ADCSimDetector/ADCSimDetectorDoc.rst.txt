Introduction
------------

This is an `EPICS <http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/>`__
`areaDetector <areaDetector.html>`__ driver for a simulated ADC driver.
This driver generates times-series data for 8 signals as a 2-D array [8,
NumTimePoints]. The signals are common waveforms (sine, cosine, square
wave, sawtooth, random noise, etc.) The driver was written in part to
test the new NDPluginTimeSeries plugin in ADCore R2-5. But it can also
serve as a starting point for writing drivers that are used to collect
time-series data like ADCs, waveform digitizers, etc.

Each signal in the driver describes a waveform. The equations governing
these signals are similar. The equation for the sine wave is the
following:

::

       Signal[t] = Offset + Noise * random() + Amplitude * sin((time * Frequency + Phase/360.) * 2. * PI);
       

This driver inherits from
`asynNDArrayDriver <areaDetectorDoc.html#asynNDArrayDriver>`__. It also
implements a number parameters that are specific to the ADC simulation
detector. The `ADCSimDetector class
documentation <areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_a_d_c_sim_detector.html>`__
describes this class in detail.

Configuration
-------------

The ADCimDetector driver is created with the ADCimDetectorConfig
command, either from C/C++ or from the EPICS IOC shell.

::

   int ADCSimDetectorConfig(const char *portName,
                         int numTimePoints, int dataType,
                         int maxBuffers, size_t maxMemory,
                         int priority, int stackSize)
     

The simDetector-specific fields in this command are:

-  ``numTimePoints`` Initial number of time points.
-  ``dataType`` Initial data type of the detector data. These are the
   enum values for NDDataType_t, i.e.

   -  0=NDInt8
   -  1=NDUInt8
   -  2=NDInt16
   -  3=NDUInt16
   -  4=NDInt32
   -  5=NDUInt32
   -  6=NDFloat32
   -  7=NDFloat64

For details on the meaning of the other parameters to this function
refer to the detailed documentation on the simDetectorConfig function in
the `ADCSimDetector.cpp
documentation <areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_c_sim_detector_8cpp.html>`__
and in the documentation for the constructor for the `ADCSimDetector
class <areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_a_d_c_sim_detector.html>`__.

There an example IOC boot directory and startup script
(`iocBoot/iocADCSimDetector/st.cmd) <ADCSimdetector_st_cmd.html>`__
provided with ADExample.

MEDM screens

The following is the MEDM screen simDetector.adl for the simulation
detector.

The NDPluginTimeSeries is used to collect the time series data from the
ADCSimDetector, perform optional averaging. In this case it is being
used in circular buffer mode. The NDArrays it produces are being used by
the NDPluginFFT plugin to compute Fast Fourier Transforms.

.. container::

   .. rubric:: NDPluginTimeSeries.adl
      :name: ndplugintimeseries.adl

   |ADCSimDetectorTimeSeriesPlugin.png|

This is a plot for the sin(x)*cos(x) output. This screen contains some
of the controls for the time series plugin.

.. container::

   .. rubric:: NDTimeSeriesPlot.adl
      :name: ndtimeseriesplot.adl

   |ADCSimDetectorSinCosPlot.png|

This is a combined plot for the square wave output. It contains the
time-series data, as well as the real, imaginary, and absolute value of
the FFT. Note that the square wave FFT contains the fundamental
frequency of 5 Hz, and all of the odd harmonics.
