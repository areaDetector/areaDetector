Introduction
============

This is an :doc:`../index` driver for the SPECS Phobios series of electron
analysers which use a Delay Line Detector (DLD)

This driver inherits from :doc:`../ADCore/ADDriver`.
It implements nearly all of the parameters in
`asynNDArrayDriver.h <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html>`__
and in
`ADArrayDriver.h <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html>`__.
It also implements a number of parameters that are specific to the
SPECS Phobios
